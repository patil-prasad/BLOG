                    <h1>Social Entrepreneurship
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        India has the world’s largest labour force of 516.3 million people, yet 1.2 million are living
                        below the poverty line. Most of them even lack even the basic necessities like health, nutrition
                        and education.
                    </p>



                </header>

                <div class="image main  wow fadeInUp" id="specific"><img alt="Social Entrepreneurship"
                        src="images/social entrepreneurship.jpg" /></div>

                <p> “We rise by lifting others.” Does this quote resonate? Well, There are some people known as ‘Social
                    Entrepreneurs’, who work for humanitarian assistance like saving lives before and after calamities,
                    also maintaining world peace, women's safety and education, etc.
                    Social Entrepreneurship is all about recognition of social problems and solving these problems by
                    entrepreneurial principles and procedures. This concept can be applied to a variety of organizations
                    with different aims, sizes and beliefs.
                </p>

                <p>Different forms of social entrepreneurship are: a community project, non-profit organizations, social
                    enterprise, co-operative and social purpose business.</p>

                <p>&centerdot; Community project: It is a small scale social project which specifies within a community.
                </p>
                <p>&centerdot; Non-profit organizations: These are bound by duty and often by law to use the income they
                    generate, to address issues relating to their mission. The main focus is on treatment of rare
                    diseases, education, women health, etc.</p>
                <p>&centerdot; Social Enterprise: Businesses that operate according to a specific social or charitable
                    mission are known as social enterprise.
                    For example, providing a job skill training to marginalized people.

                </p>
                <p>&centerdot; Co-operative: These are member-owned and work on no-profit or for-profit basis.</p>
                <p>&centerdot; Social purpose business: An organization that strives to strike an ideal balance between
                    for-profit organizations and non-profit ones is a social purpose business.</p>


                <p>Entrepreneurial quality builds creativity. Social entrepreneurs are creative enough to have a vision
                    of what they want to see and how to make that vision happen.
                    India's best social entrepreneurs like Jeroo Bilimoria is the founder of several international NGOs
                    and has been working on recent ventures like Aflatoun, Childline India Foundation and child helpline
                    International. Also, Harish Hande founder SELCO has installed 1,20,000 system in rural areas of
                    Karnataka. Bharatiya Samruddhi Investments and consulting services( BASIX) founded be Vijay Mahajan
                    is the first Microfinance project to lend to the poor.


                </p>

                <p>At the college level, in the year 2018 when I was in my first year of Engineering, my friends and I
                    thought of getting into this space of social entrepreneurship. The idea was to help the
                    underprivileged children by giving them a product called as the convertible desk. These children
                    used plastic bags to carry their books and also sit on the floor which affected their back posture.
                    This product could solve these problems and could be converted from desk to bag and vice-versa which
                    was basically made of cardboard. All of us made about around 20 of these and went on to distribute
                    them. Apart from part of us doing this small scaled startup, it gave us a very irreplaceable feeling
                    of satisfaction as well as responsibility looking at the joy of those children. All of us in some
                    way should give back to the society, which is basically social entrepreneurship!
                </p>

                <p>If you’re confused with social entrepreneurship with just helping the poor or some kind of a
                    donation, then you’re surely mistaken. Yes, poverty being a major and a universal setback for the
                    society, many of the organizations, entrepreneurs turn to that path but Shiza Shahid had some bigger
                    plans. She is the co-founder and the global ambassador of the Malala Fund. As we all know, Malala
                    Yousafzia, the symbol of World peace was shot by some men for asking for the education right, was
                    firm about continuing the campaign for gender equality and education in Pakistan. Shiza, thought of
                    taking a strategic and a safer move for Malala of starting a fund and approached her. This fund was
                    finally created by the Standford University grad named after Malala back in 2012.</p>

                <p>Social entrepreneurship basically is huge spectrum having variety of issues under it. If we go to
                    dissect each aspect, it’ll take some years! This blogs covers just a tiny section of this broad
                    spectrum. As long as there are social, environmental, cultural problems social entrepreneurship is
                    going to live and thrive. Also, I feel India is the best place for social entrepreneurship. Every
                    business has its problems but solving them can make a lot of lives happier. Social entrepreneurship
                    has evolved from corporate to non-profit and now to self- sustaining ones and also has proved to
                    give a better future to the people.</p>
